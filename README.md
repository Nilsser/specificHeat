This repo provides the code used for the D-MAVT physics experiment at ETH ZÃ¼rich to determine the specific heat capacity of copper and aluminum. 

calculations.ipynb contains all the steps needeed to calculate the specific heat capacity of the samples. 

In helpers.py and errors.py you find helper functions to read in the data and do calculations.
It is highly recommended to read the report (or the manual) before trying to figure out what the code does.
